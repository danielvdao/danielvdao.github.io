Hi!

My name is Daniel Vu Dao. I always find it interesting that there doesn't seem to exist another Daniel Vu Dao who's involved in Computer Science. If you type my name in on Google, you'll stumble upon majority of my professional websites / projects / interests, and some horrifingly old photos. That being said, this is my personal blog + website. It's sporadically updated, at best. Most of these posts document how I'm feeling, and you'll notice I have a tendency to write on non-technical issues as opposed to technical ones involved in Software Engineering. This is because I find that many technical problems have already been solved, or if not, are currently being solved by people much more gifted and involved than I am. Rather than software problems, the most interesting problems to me involve us! (Yay, humans!) Emotions, software management, and ethics are some of the most complex and fascinating parts of Software Engineering. By no means am I a philosopher, sociologist, or psychologist. In fact -- you shouldn't even take my blog too seriously. If you do, you'll probably be end up more confused than you were when you started reading.
