Hi, my name is Daniel. I'm studying Computer Science in hill country, also known as The University of Texas at Austin. I enjoy tennis, weightlifting, and excessive periods where I can Wikipedia interesting historical facts for fun. Additionally, I'm obsessed with finding new music, and will spend atrocious amounts of time on SoundCloud looking for music. On days where I'm not doing any of those, you'll find me occassionally reading books, although it's an old habit I've recently tried to get back into.


Regardless, you've managed to stumble upon my blog, which means a few things. Either: 

* You're a bot whose scraping my website, and will grab my email and phone number. This will lead to a few things, I'll either filter your email, or just refuse your call. 
* You've accidentally managed to get here. Well, if that's the case, I'd like to redirect you to [Quora], where you'll find plenty of interesting writers, who know far more about obscure details than I do. 
* You're really really interested in me. If that's the case, then I welcome you to my personal blog.

I'd like to think that everybody who ends up at this page is the third option, however that is not always the case. Despite that, I hope that you enjoy your time on my blog, and learn something new.
