Hi!

My name is Daniel Vu Dao. I earned a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from The University of Texas at Austin. I left Austin soon afterwards to move back to California, where I had originally spent 10-ish years growing up. I have a tendency to specialize in backend, mainly centered around data platform or data centric tools. I prefer to work in tech that aligns closely with people or civic tech.

Outside of engineering: I like to read, run, and joke about the absurdity of the world. My preferred pronouns are he/him/his. By day I am a person who writes code, and by night I moonlight at a bookstore, suicide hotline, and soon-to-be hospice. People ask me why I do so much and I usually ask them why I do so little. I have a tendency to be overtly wordy and non-sensical which makes me an extreme joy to be around (or so I've been told?).
