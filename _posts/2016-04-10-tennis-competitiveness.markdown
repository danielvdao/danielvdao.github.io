title: "Where My Competitive Nature Comes From"

I'd like to think tennis and games as the two largest sources of my competitive nature. Growing up, I was gifted a GameBoy from my parents (which, was probably given to make me talk less) and a few video games (go Pokemon!). From then on, I started my descent into video games. I played at least 2-4 hours daily when I was in elementary school. I would spend evenings trying to find that special rare pokemon, or grinding out levels to try to beat my friend in a battle the next day.

Cue middle school when I met a group of friends who had an ambitious love for Halo. I begged my parents for a Xbox 360, and next thing I knew, I was playing around 5-7 hours after school, depending on how much homework I had. Nights were spent yelling into a microphone, with emphasis on unrealistic call of duty military tactics.

Entering high school, I tried to make an oath to myself to stop playing video games, so I ended up picking up a sport which I did on the side during seventh and eighth grade, tennis. 

Tennis is kind of an on and off game for me. I was driven by passion and would spend half of my day watching videos of professional players hitting, trying to copy their shots to no avail. At some points, I was burnt out, and as a result, would back away from playing for weeks, and up until recently, years. Needless to say, tennis and video games have contributed heavily to my competitive nature, and consequently, my willpower to grind through anything.

I'd say that it's also caused me a lot of trouble, reuslting in so much time on multiple things, only to find it dentrimental to my well-being. 

I want to say I'm glad that I've always committed myself to some form of competition. It's a little bit overused, but video games and tennis lessons always come up in my life. Whether it be the problem-solving nature of a video game, or the mental focus of a tennis match, I've always found myself looking back at the teaching of my tennis coach, or my kill/death ratio (hello to my Call of Duty fans).
