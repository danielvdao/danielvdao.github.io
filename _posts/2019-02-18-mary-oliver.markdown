"Wasn't your friendship always as beautiful

as a flame?"



_Devotions_, specifically a quote from _For Tom Shaw S.S.J.E (1945-2014)_ by Mary Oliver

I'm a sucker for poetry and lately I've been getting into Mary Oliver who recently passed. Her nature poetry is wonderful, but this one had me torn. Too often we value our romantic relationships, but don't focus hardly enough on our platonic ones!
