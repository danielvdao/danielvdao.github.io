as of right now i'm pretty glad to have started a blog. this is something i've been meaning to do for quite a long time and finally have pushed myself to do it. if you can tell, this blog was started with the standard jekyll theme and all that. it's kind of cool how jekyll compiles all of the markdown files into standard html, to avoid all that database storage/lag. 

anyways, hi... my name is daniel! well that was awkward. i'm a senior in computer science at The University of Texas at Austin and have a strong focus towards software engineering. i'm not particularly the most talented software engineer, but i try my best. this blog will eventually be where i pour my thoughts and some cool projects that i'm currently working on. 

that's all, thanks for reading!
