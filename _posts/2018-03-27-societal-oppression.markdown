When 2018 started I set off to read about 40 books for the year. One of my main goals was not just for vanity's sake, but it was to increase my understanding of the societal issues that have contributed to the world's current problems. This doesn't just extend to capitalism as my recent readings have been, but also poverty, wealth inequality, racism, and sexism (I do agree that I need to look at more heterosexism literature too). And after reading a couple of books, I've found that the oppression is deeply rooted and unequal. There is so much foundation and structural contributions as to the different types of oppression that we experience today. Whether it is in the Bible (Adam & Eve - Eve's mistake in eating the apple) or whether it is in the feminist movement (horizontal oppression versus vertical oppression - racism), it's hard to navigate the path to a possible solution without diversifying our movements.

After looking around rigorously for possible movements to join, one of the most prominent issues I've come across is the lack of diversity within a field. Whether it is in technology, grassroots non-profits, or activist movements I've concluded that a majority of causes are segregated, whether it be by race or gender. Consequently this fracturing causes a deep rift within groups aiming towards similar goals and pivots the issues from vertical to horizontal.

What I mean is that groups target others within similar movements (Audre Lorde's reference to Black males being sexist Black females, disregarding that they are aiming towards racial equality), resulting in time wasted and the top (top in regards to benefactors of the oppressed) benefitting.

 This is more of a digest of what I've been reading lately, and is by no means a suggestion towards any solution. Rather it is an observation that we are constantly fractured and will continue to be unless we become an inclusive and loving world. After volunteering at the Suicide Hotline and reading James Baldiwn, Audre Lorde, etc. I have come to firmly believe that with love and understanding our movements will become stronger. Yes, there is still a problem in the lack of structure within grassroots movements (I will not comment on that, I don't believe I have enough understanding into how difficult it is to organize one), but I believe that inclusivity of all folks will lead us towards a commonality which we can all accept.

Therefore oppression is not equal, and we must recognize that because without acknowledging that, we will never progress towards a greater world.
