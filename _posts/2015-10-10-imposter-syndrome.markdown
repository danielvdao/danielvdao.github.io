well this is my first post. what exactly is imposter syndrome and what does it mean? for me, imposter syndrome is the constant issue of comparing myself to my peers, professors, and coworkers. it's when i feel like i'm not up to standards, or just not as intelligent as others. although the CS world has been better about tackling the issue of imposter syndrome, i think there's still a lot of work that needs to be done. 

in a major consisted with so many intelligent people, it's hard not to sometimes be arrogant. i think sometimes we need to humble ourselves and realize, that despite being a CS major, there's much more to this world. and i say "we" as a target to everyone. admittedly at some points, i'm sure i slip and and fall into that arrogant category too. 

it's tough really -- i've seen people drop, and i've seen people break down in CS, mainly because they didn't want to seem like they were faking it, or that they weren't smart compared to others. we should all accept that we still have to learn, and to never put down others who don't know the material we know. i know that's a poor way of describing it, but seriously, just be nice. be open, talk about failures, and guide others.

if you don't know anything, that's fine. i don't either, in fact nobody does. everyone out there is trying just as hard as you to catch up. there was a stage when my imposter syndrome was so terrible it impaired me from doing CS assignments because i was afraid of not knowing what to do. trust me, if you're reading this for the sake of not being alone, it does get better.
