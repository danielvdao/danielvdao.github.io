Some of the most difficult things to tell my white friends is that I can’t tell them the fullness of my discomfort. It’s hard to describe, but I can feel my vocabulary and mind lock up when I am in a group of white people. I can physically feel my body tense up, and my mind contort in different ways. It is difficult because where I live is heavily condensed of White and Asian folks. It is also difficult because the Bay Area is consisted of privileged folks, and in that sense, they do not have the same set of experiences that I have had concerning race.

There are days when I wonder if it is because I grew up conditioned in a system of Anglo standards? Maybe it was because my father was an English major, and had a deeply romanticized view of the Anglo history. Was it him who told me that white people deserve a higher level of interaction and are warranted more comfort than others? Was it him who tried to make me believe that white folks are more innately intelligent than others? There are moments when I wonder if people of color are forever doomed to the stereotypes and prejudices that have annihilated our cultures. Sadly I wouldn’t like to know the answer to this question.

Despite my pessimism with regards to the experiences of people of color, the reality is that it is not just us who experiences this discomfort and frustration. I have spoken to my friend, who is a wonderful person and a white woman. She too experiences this struggle, she speaks of it when she works in an area where there is not many white people. She tells me she is uncomfortable around people of color, and it frustrates her to no end. 

The reality is that the discomfort and emotional / physical exhaustion exists everywhere. It is this un-nameable feeling that exists within all of us. There are many questions that I have. How do we accept the differences amongst one another? How do we shatter the invisible barriers that disconnect us from one another? How can we put a name to something that we can barely explain?

I made an attempt this year at speaking up and becoming more honest with who I was. At distilling my abstract emotions into something more concrete and fulfilling. To some degree I succeeded and to some degree, I failed. 

I want to make a stronger attempt at speaking up, for the causes I deeply care for. For the pain that people struggle to admit. I had held back on this issue for a long time because I thought my experiences were invalid. I envisioned myself as crazy and neurotic. I thought myself to be insane and delusional. But then I realized that this discomfort is pervasive amongst all people. Of course it is a discomfort more definitive in people of color, but it is also existent in white folks too.

The question as always is how do we solve this ongoing disconnect? How do we reunite with the people who we have chosen to separate from? It is trite to say that folks should simply just love, and that through love it’ll become better. The reality is for folks to speak up about it. We must listen to each other’s stories actively, validate each other’s experiences thoughtfully, and respect each other’s presence wholeheartedly. It is with these three focal points that we will unearth the pain we have hidden.
