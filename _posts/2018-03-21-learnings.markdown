When I looked back at my last post, I couldn't stop laughing. It was audcacious of me to think I could write every day. I've always been one to have ambitious goals, at least when it comes to self-improvement. I'll admit it's one of the more yuppie-esque things about me. Despite that, 2018 is here and I really haven't written in forever. A lot of things have changed since my last post, and a few more things will be changing soon.

1) My resume now marks the end of my time at Munchery. It's been a brief an interesting stint. I learned a lot about myself, my goals, and a lot of my desires when it comes to software engineering. I hesitate to say where I'll be going and what I'll be doing next, but you'll learn soon enough if you keep up to date!

2) I've been frenzied when it comes to volunteering. Volunteering has always been something I cared about. For selfish reasons, I believe it's important to take a holistic approach to life and embrace situations that make one uncomfortable -- poverty, health, or education. From an extrinsic standpoint, it's amazing to see people succeed and help them get to where they want to be. I encourage everyone to look into volunteering within their community. The connection that you form with your neighborhood and its residents is very powerful and not one to be overlooked.

3) I did my first marathon in January! It was a brutal few months of training that pushed me to my extremes. Mornings where I didn't expect to wake up at 5:30 AM to run 15 - 20 miles, and mornings where I couldn't move in the blistering cold when it was <50 degrees. Regardless, it was an amazing experience and running warrants a post in itself.

Ultimately I think my life has undergone a lot of change the past year, for better or worst -- I'm not entirely sure yet. But one thing is that the people in my life have changed. It's amazing how many different people you can meet and form a connection with. I always get sappy and write about how grateful I am to my friends, but I never any other way to express my thoughts. Without my friends (old and new), I don't think I'd be able to be where I am. Many late-night conversations, drunken nights, and thought-provoking discussions have helped me progress to where I am today, and I am eternally grateful to all of you.

Anyways, this is just a preview post! There's more to come, and maybe a site redesign if I'm not too lazy.

Cheers,
Daniel
