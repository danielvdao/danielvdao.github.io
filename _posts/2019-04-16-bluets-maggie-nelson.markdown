_"Loneliness is solitude with a problem."_


Currently reading _Bluets_ by Maggie Nelson. It's okay so far, not really my type of writing because it's nonlinear and difficult for me to follow. I'm a slow reader so it's often hard for me to keep up with multiple stories.

However I thought the quote tied really neatly with Rilke's quote from _Letters to a Young Poet_.

_"For one human being to love another; that is perhaps the most difficult of all our tasks, the ultimate, the last test and proof, the work for which all other work is but preparation. I hold this to be the highest task for a bond between two people: that each protects the solitude of the other.This is the miracle that happens every time to those who really love: the more they give, the more they possess."_

And Simone de Beauvoir's quote from _The Ethics of Ambiguity_:

_"A freedom which is interested only in denying freedom must be denied."_

I think all of the above quotes represent the importance of independence, solitude, and protecting each other's right to carve their own world.
