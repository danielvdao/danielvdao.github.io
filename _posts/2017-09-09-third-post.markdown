The great thing about writing everyday is that I get immediate feeback on how my writing is. Being able to instantly observe, correct, and iterate on my previous writing is something that I am attempting to focus on more. I've noticed that I tend to gravitate towards short sentences and blurps, however I don't elaborate and explain more of my thought processes. This is definitely a sticking point in my writing, and I figure I will need to improve on this eventually.

One thing I've currently noticed about my website, is that some of the pages aren't very functional. The HTML is being rendered, but for some reason the CSS isn't being applied properly. Knowing me and my non-ui skills, this is going to be a work in progress for me to fix.

Aside from the website currently being down, I'll be pleased to say I have finally purchased a Kindle. Needless to say this isn't the end of my foray into paperback / hardcover books, however it'll just be easier for me to decide on which books I actually want to purchase. I'll definitely need to be cognizant when I buy books, in that I don't just buy books in which I love, rather books that I find useful. One of the greatest things about having a book, is that I'm able to loan them to other people, and at same time, admit that I don't necessarily _like_ the book, but I appreciate its opinion.

Somewhat relating to books, tomorrow is the start of my Coursera writing class! I'm very excited to try to improve my writing, seeing as this is the first large effort I've put into it. I'll be documenting my process, along with other random blurps that come up

Anyways that's all for today, I'll need to start reading now.

Cheers!
