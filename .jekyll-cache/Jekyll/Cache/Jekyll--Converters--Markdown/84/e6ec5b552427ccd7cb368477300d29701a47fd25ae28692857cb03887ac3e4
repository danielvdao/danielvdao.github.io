I"û<p>As of right now Iâ€™m pretty glad to have started a blog. This is something Iâ€™ve been meaning to do for quite a long time and finally have pushed myself to do it. If you can tell, this blog was started with the standard jekyll theme and all that. Itâ€™s kind of cool how jekyll compiles all of the markdown files into standard html, to avoid all that database storage/lag.</p>

<p>Anyways, hiâ€¦ My name is Daniel! Well that was awkward. Iâ€™m a senior in computer science at The University of Texas at Austin and have a strong focus towards software engineering. Iâ€™m not particularly the most talented software engineer, but I try my best. This blog will eventually be where I pour my thoughts and some cool projects that Iâ€™m currently working on.</p>
