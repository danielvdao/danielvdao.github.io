<p>When 2018 started I set off to read about 40 books for the year. One of my main goals was not just for vanityâ€™s sake, but it was to increase my understanding of the societal issues that have contributed to the worldâ€™s current problems. This doesnâ€™t just extend to capitalism as my recent readings have been, but also poverty, wealth inequality, racism, and sexism (I do agree that I need to look at more heterosexism literature too). And after reading a couple of books, Iâ€™ve found that oppression is deeply rooted and unequal. There has been so much literary, historical, and -ism contributions as to the multitudes of oppression that we experience. Whether it is in the religious Bible (Adam &amp; Eve - Eveâ€™s mistake in eating the apple) or in the historical context of the feminist movement (horizontal oppression versus vertical oppression - racism), itâ€™s been hard to navigate the path towards a possible solution.</p>

<p>After rigorously looking around for possible movements to join, one of the most prominent issues Iâ€™ve come across is the lack of diversity within a field. Whether it is in technology, grassroots, non-profits, or activist movements Iâ€™ve concluded that a majority of causes are unfortunately segregated, whether it be by race, gender, or etc. Consequently this fracturing has caused a deep rift within groups aiming towards similar goals and has pivoted issues from vertical to horizontal.</p>

<p>To elaborate, itâ€™s been evident that groups target others within similar movements (Audre Lordeâ€™s reference to Black males being sexist towards Black females, disregarding that they are both aiming towards racial equality), resulting in time wasted and the top (benefactors of the oppressed) benefitting.</p>

<p>These conclusions are more of a digest of what Iâ€™ve been reading lately, and are by no means a solution. Rather, it is an observation and suggestion that we are constantly fractured and will continue to be unless we become a more inclusive and loving world. After volunteering at the Suicide Hotline and reading James Baldiwn, Audre Lorde, etc. I have come to the belief that love and understanding will contribute greatly towards unity and empowering our ideals. Yes, there is still a problem in the lack of structure within grassroots movements and non-profits (I will not comment on that; I donâ€™t believe I have enough understanding into how difficult it is to organize and maintain one), but I believe that inclusivity of all folks will lead us towards some commonality which we can accept.</p>

<p><em>To summarize, we must recognize that oppression is not equal, and that we will never progress unless we realize that.</em></p>
