I"¶<p>HackRice 2016 was probably the last hackathon for me. At least for a very long time. I had a bittersweet feeling the other day thinking about it, wondering if Iâ€™ll ever be able to encounter the same atmosphere anymore.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ll miss the frustrating late nights, the terrible amounts of pizza they feed you, and best of all, The enjoyment you have just laughing with your buddies. Itâ€™s really sad thinking that majority of my friends in computer science are all splitting up after college. Itâ€™s like that feeling you get after high school graduation, when youâ€™re standing there and youâ€™re like â€œI just did it, I just graduatedâ€, but then you realize that everyoneâ€™s going off to college.</p>

<p>And that itâ€™s going to change, some people are going to meet new friends, be in new environments, and just not be the same when they come back. Or maybe theyâ€™ll just be too busy to come back. And thatâ€™s okay, in fact, I have no resentment when it comes to that. but I canâ€™t lie and say that I wonâ€™t miss the it all. That feeling when I walk into a hackathon with my friends, and we just stand there laughing about what to do, shooting down each otherâ€™s lame ideas, and just yelling at APIs that are â€œso easy to useâ€.</p>

<p>I realize that I sound a bit immature, and that Iâ€™m unwilling to graduate or whatever. But thatâ€™s really not the case. Iâ€™m looking forward to graduation and everything, Iâ€™m looking forward to everyone taking a step forward in their lives, and Iâ€™m looking forward to seeing all the tears that will be shed.</p>

<p>So yeah, I think thatâ€™s my update. Itâ€™s been awhile so hello world again to whoever reads this blog.</p>

<p>Cheers yâ€™all.</p>
