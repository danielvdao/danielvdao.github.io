I"ç<p>The great thing about writing everyday is that I get immediate feeback on how my writing is. Being able to instantly observe, correct, and iterate on my previous writing is something that I am attempting to focus on more. Iâ€™ve noticed that I tend to gravitate towards short sentences and blurps, however I donâ€™t elaborate and explain more of my thought processes. This is definitely a sticking point in my writing, and I figure I will need to improve on this eventually.</p>

<p>One thing Iâ€™ve currently noticed about my website, is that some of the pages arenâ€™t very functional. The HTML is being rendered, but for some reason the CSS isnâ€™t being applied properly. Knowing me and my non-ui skills, this is going to be a work in progress for me to fix.</p>

<p>Aside from the website currently being down, Iâ€™ll be pleased to say I have finally purchased a Kindle. Needless to say this isnâ€™t the end of my foray into paperback / hardcover books, however itâ€™ll just be easier for me to decide on which books I actually want to purchase. Iâ€™ll definitely need to be cognizant when I buy books, in that I donâ€™t just buy books in which I love, rather books that I find useful. One of the greatest things about having a book, is that Iâ€™m able to loan them to other people, and at same time, admit that I donâ€™t necessarily <em>like</em> the book, but I appreciate its opinion.</p>

<p>Somewhat relating to books, tomorrow is the start of my Coursera writing class! Iâ€™m very excited to try to improve my writing, seeing as this is the first large effort Iâ€™ve put into it. Iâ€™ll be documenting my process, along with other random blurps that come up</p>

<p>Anyways thatâ€™s all for today, Iâ€™ll need to start reading now.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>
