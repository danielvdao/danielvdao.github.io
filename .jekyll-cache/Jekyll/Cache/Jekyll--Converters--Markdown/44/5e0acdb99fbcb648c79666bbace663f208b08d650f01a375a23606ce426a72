I"Ã<p>â€œWasnâ€™t your friendship always as beautiful</p>

<p>as a flame?â€</p>

<p><em>Devotions</em>, specifically a quote from <em>For Tom Shaw S.S.J.E (1945-2014)</em> by Mary Oliver</p>

<p>Iâ€™m a sucker for poetry and lately Iâ€™ve been getting into Mary Oliver who recently passed. Her nature poetry is wonderful, but this one had me torn. Too often we value our romantic relationships, but donâ€™t focus hardly enough on our platonic ones!</p>
