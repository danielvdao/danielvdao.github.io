I"Õ	<p>When I looked back at my last post, I couldnâ€™t stop laughing. It was audcacious of me to think I could write every day. Iâ€™ve always been one to have ambitious goals, at least when it comes to self-improvement. Iâ€™ll admit itâ€™s one of the more yuppie-esque things about me. Despite that, 2018 is here and I really havenâ€™t written in forever. A lot of things have changed since my last post, and a few more things will be changing soon.</p>

<p>1) My resume now marks the end of my time at Munchery. Itâ€™s been a brief an interesting stint. I learned a lot about myself, my goals, and a lot of my desires when it comes to software engineering. I hesitate to say where Iâ€™ll be going and what Iâ€™ll be doing next, but youâ€™ll learn soon enough if you keep up to date!</p>

<p>2) Iâ€™ve been frenzied when it comes to volunteering. Volunteering has always been something I cared about. For selfish reasons, I believe itâ€™s important to take a holistic approach to life and embrace situations that make one uncomfortable â€“ poverty, health, or education. From an extrinsic standpoint, itâ€™s amazing to see people succeed and help them get to where they want to be. I encourage everyone to look into volunteering within their community. The connection that you form with your neighborhood and its residents is very powerful and not one to be overlooked.</p>

<p>3) I did my first marathon in January! It was a brutal few months of training that pushed me to my extremes. Mornings where I didnâ€™t expect to wake up at 5:30 AM to run 15 - 20 miles, and mornings where I couldnâ€™t move in the blistering cold when it was &lt;50 degrees. Regardless, it was an amazing experience and running warrants a post in itself.</p>

<p>Ultimately I think my life has undergone a lot of change the past year, for better or worst â€“ Iâ€™m not entirely sure yet. But one thing is that the people in my life have changed. Itâ€™s amazing how many different people you can meet and form a connection with. I always get sappy and write about how grateful I am to my friends, but I never any other way to express my thoughts. Without my friends (old and new), I donâ€™t think Iâ€™d be able to be where I am. Many late-night conversations, drunken nights, and thought-provoking discussions have helped me progress to where I am today, and I am eternally grateful to all of you.</p>

<p>Anyways, this is just a preview post! Thereâ€™s more to come, and maybe a site redesign if Iâ€™m not too lazy.</p>

<p>Cheers,
Daniel</p>
