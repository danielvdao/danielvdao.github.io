I"¸<p>The constant problem of comparing myself to my peers, professors, and coworkers. Itâ€™s when I feel like Iâ€™m not up to standards, or just not as gifted as others. Although the CS world has been better about tackling the issue of imposter syndrome, thereâ€™s still a long way to go.</p>

<p>We tend to forget nowadays that weâ€™re in a major saturated with so many intelligent people, and as a result, itâ€™s so hard to not be arrogant. As a remedy, we should humble ourselves and realize thereâ€™s much more to this world around us. I say â€œweâ€ as a target to everyone. Admittedly at some points, Iâ€™m sure I can fall into that arrogant category too.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s a tough issue really â€“ Iâ€™ve seen people drop, and Iâ€™ve seen people break down in the CS field, mainly because they didnâ€™t want to seem like they were faking it, or that they werenâ€™t smart compared to others. We should all accept that we still have more to learn, and to never put down others who donâ€™t know the material we know. I know thatâ€™s a poor way of describing it, but seriously, just be nice. Be open, talk about failures, and guide others when theyâ€™re lost.</p>

<p>And at the end of this, if you donâ€™t know anything and youâ€™re worred, thatâ€™s fine. I donâ€™t either, in fact nobody does. Everyone out there is trying just as hard as you to fake it. There was a stage when my imposter syndrome was so terrible, that it impaired me from doing coding assignments because I was afraid of not knowing what to do. Or when I was terrified of career fair because I would look so stupid. You donâ€™t need to believe me when I say that it gets better. Just know one thing, that at the end of it all, youâ€™re not alone.</p>
