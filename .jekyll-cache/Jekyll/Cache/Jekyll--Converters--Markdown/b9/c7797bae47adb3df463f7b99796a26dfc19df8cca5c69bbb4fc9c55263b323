I"<p><em>â€œLoneliness is solitude with a problem.â€</em></p>

<p>Currently reading <em>Bluets</em> by Maggie Nelson. Itâ€™s okay so far, not really my type of writing because itâ€™s nonlinear and difficult for me to follow. Iâ€™m a slow reader so itâ€™s often hard for me to keep up with multiple stories.</p>

<p>However I thought the quote tied really neatly with Rilkeâ€™s quote from <em>Letters to a Young Poet</em>.</p>

<p><em>â€œFor one human being to love another; that is perhaps the most difficult of all our tasks, the ultimate, the last test and proof, the work for which all other work is but preparation. I hold this to be the highest task for a bond between two people: that each protects the solitude of the other.This is the miracle that happens every time to those who really love: the more they give, the more they possess.â€</em></p>

<p>And Simone de Beauvoirâ€™s quote from <em>The Ethics of Ambiguity</em>:</p>

<p><em>â€œA freedom which is interested only in denying freedom must be denied.â€</em></p>

<p>I think all of the above quotes represent the importance of independence, solitude, and protecting each otherâ€™s right to carve their own world.</p>
