I"Ù<p>For people who have followed my blog since the beginning of time, yâ€™all will have noticed a slight change over night. Other than the theme, Iâ€™ve decided to reword all of my blog to proper punctuation/capitalization. When I first started this blog, my main concern was sounding too professional, and that by focusing on capitalization and punctuation, I would focus too much on what other people thought â€“ as opposed to how I generally write to my friends.</p>

<p>So to approach that reasoning, I wanted to say that nothingâ€™s changed. Iâ€™m still the same old DVD, Daniel Vu Dao, danyuldow that many have known. In fact, the capitalization was mainly a stylistic choice. Iâ€™ve tried to approach things from a design perspective, so considering that the links on my navigation bar are properly formatted, I decided it was best to swap the whole blog over. Iâ€™m generally a messy person, but for some reason, I try to keep my digital footprint as organized as possible.</p>
