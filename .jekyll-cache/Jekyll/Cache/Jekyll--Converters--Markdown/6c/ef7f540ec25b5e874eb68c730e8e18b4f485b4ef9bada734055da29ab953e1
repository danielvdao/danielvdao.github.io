I"Â<p>A casual update on my life, for whoeverâ€™s interested. Iâ€™ve been super busy now, ever since that I started work at Civitas Learning.</p>

<p>My life has been a lot more time consuming than usual, however I wanted to note, that Iâ€™ve:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Met some really amazing people.</li>
  <li>Am working on something I am extremely passionate about.</li>
  <li>Learned an extraodinary amount, contrary to what I originally believed would happen.</li>
  <li>Have been slowly focusing more on tennis, and applying what I learn to my every day routine.</li>
  <li>And have been more ingrossed in my friendships.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course there are many problems that Iâ€™m currently facing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>My dilemna with my mentality in tennis, I tend to falter a lot under high stress situations.</li>
  <li>My slow thought process, I process things very slowly, and as a result, many problems can go over my head when I push myself.</li>
  <li>Moving out â€“ as stupid as this sounds, Iâ€™ve been very stressed about fully moving out of my old apartment.</li>
  <li>My fitness, it was one of my top focuses, and now I have to admit, Iâ€™ve been slowly declining on my dietary habits and fitness goals.</li>
</ul>

<p>So I can say that life is just how itâ€™s mean to be, confusing, but fun. Itâ€™s been a hell of a ride ever since I got back from Europe. Iâ€™m hoping that things will still turn out better soon and that Iâ€™ll enjoy my life in Austin even more.</p>
